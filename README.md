# CS330 Course Project – Operating Systems

This repository contains the course project for **CS330: Introduction to Operating Systems**.  
The project is divided into **two phases** and focuses on understanding and applying core operating system concepts in a Linux environment using C.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with operating system concepts such as:

- Process management
- Parallel execution
- System-level programming in C
- Performance measurement and analysis
- Working within a Linux environment

The project emphasizes practical experimentation and analysis rather than algorithm design.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into **two phases**:

### Phase I
Phase I focuses on:
- Setting up a Linux environment using a virtual machine
- Compiling and running a provided C program
- Using process creation (`fork()`) to execute parallel workloads
- Measuring and analyzing execution time under different configurations
- Evaluating performance and scalability

### Phase II
Phase II will build upon Phase I and further explore operating system concepts as specified by the course instructor.

(Details for Phase II will be added once released.)
