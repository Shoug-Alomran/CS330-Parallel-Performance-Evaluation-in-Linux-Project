# Phase I Overview

Phase I of the CS330 course project focuses on establishing the execution environment and performing an initial experimental evaluation of process-based parallelism in Linux.

This phase serves as the foundation for the project by ensuring that the provided program can be compiled, executed, and analyzed correctly under different configurations.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of Phase I are to:

- Set up a Linux environment using a virtual machine
- Compile and execute the provided C program successfully
- Understand how process creation is used to achieve parallel execution
- Measure execution time under different parameter settings
- Collect performance data for analysis and reporting

## Scope of Work

Phase I emphasizes **execution and measurement**, not program redesign. The provided source code is used as-is, with changes limited to configurable parameters such as:

- Input size
- Number of processes

The goal is to observe how these parameters affect performance rather than to optimize or rewrite the algorithm.

## Deliverables

The deliverables for Phase I include:

- A documented Linux and virtual machine setup
- Successful compilation and execution results
- Recorded performance measurements
- Tables and/or graphs summarizing results
- A written report analyzing observed performance trends

## Outcome

By completing Phase I, the project establishes a reliable experimental setup and produces baseline performance results. These results will inform further analysis and any extensions required in Phase II.
