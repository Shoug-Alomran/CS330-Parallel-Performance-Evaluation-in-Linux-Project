# Project Requirements

This section outlines the technical and academic requirements for the CS330 course project. These requirements apply across all project phases unless otherwise specified.

## Environment Requirements

The project must be completed in a **Linux environment** to ensure consistency and reproducibility. A virtual machine is used to meet this requirement.

- Linux operating system (Ubuntu recommended)
- Virtual machine platform (e.g., VirtualBox)
- Sufficient system resources to run experiments reliably

## Programming Requirements

- The project uses the **C programming language**
- Programs must be compiled using the **GCC compiler**
- System-level programming concepts must be followed
- The provided source code serves as the base for experimentation

## Execution and Experimentation

- The program must be compiled and executed in Linux
- Performance measurements must be taken for different configurations
- Modifications are limited to configurable parameters (e.g., input size, number of processes)
- Multiple runs should be performed to ensure reliable timing results

## Documentation Requirements

- All work must be clearly documented
- The project must include:
  - Description of the environment setup
  - Explanation of experimental methodology
  - Presentation of results using tables and/or graphs
  - Written analysis of observed behavior
- Reports must be clear, well-structured, and professionally formatted

## Project Phases

- The project is divided into **two phases**
- Each phase has its own deliverables and documentation
- Phase-specific requirements will be addressed in their respective sections

## Academic Integrity

- All work must comply with the university’s academic integrity policies
- Proper attribution must be provided where applicable
- Collaboration must follow the guidelines provided by the course instructor
