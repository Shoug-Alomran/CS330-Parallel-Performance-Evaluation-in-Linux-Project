# Project Overview

This project is part of the **CS330: Introduction to Operating Systems** course and is designed to provide hands-on experience with core operating system concepts through practical experimentation and analysis.

The project is divided into **two phases**. Each phase focuses on different aspects of operating system behavior in a Linux environment using system-level programming in C.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Understand process creation and management in Linux
- Explore parallel execution using multiple processes
- Measure and analyze execution time under different configurations
- Evaluate performance and scalability behavior
- Practice structured technical documentation

## Scope

The project emphasizes **experimental evaluation** rather than algorithm design. A provided program is used as the basis for experimentation, and modifications are limited to configuration parameters such as problem size and number of processes.

All experiments are conducted in a Linux environment to ensure consistency and reproducibility.

## Project Phases

### Phase I
Phase I focuses on:
- Setting up a Linux environment using a virtual machine
- Compiling and running the provided C program
- Executing the program with different parameters
- Collecting and analyzing performance data

### Phase II
Phase II will build upon the foundation established in Phase I and will be completed according to the instructions provided later by the course instructor.

## Tools and Technologies

The project uses the following tools and technologies:

- **C programming language**
- **Linux (Ubuntu)**
- **GCC compiler**
- **Virtual machine environment** (e.g., VirtualBox)
- **MkDocs** for documentation

This documentation site serves as a centralized location for project information, experiment results, and reports for both phases.
